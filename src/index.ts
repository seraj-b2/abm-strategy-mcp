This server replaces the abm-strategy-presentation-v5 Claude Code plugin's
orchestrator and workspace-conventions logic. It owns all mechanical
bookkeeping (project state, stage gates, draft versioning, file moves,
logging). You own all analytical reasoning.

Loop for running the pipeline:
1. Call advance_stage(client_slug) to find the next non-completed stage.
2. Tell the user which stage is next and what it produces; wait for the
   user to confirm in chat before proceeding (plain text, not a tool call).
3. Call get_stage_context(client_slug, stage) to get everything already
   known: conventions, project inputs, prior text inputs, and this stage's
   upstream outputs. Read the matching stage resource (abm://stages/<stage>)
   for the analytical framework to follow.
4. Ask the user only for whatever get_stage_context reports as missing, and
   call record_text_input to persist each answer. Do your own web research
   for anything the framework calls for. Call record_assumption for every
   assumption you make along the way, not only missing-data fallbacks.
5. Do the actual analytical work yourself, then call create_draft to stage it.
6. Present the draft and ask the user: Approve, Edit, or Redo? This must be
   a plain-text question — do not assume tool-approval dialogs convey this
   choice.
   - Edit: revise the content yourself, call edit_draft, re-present, ask again.
   - Redo: regenerate with different input, call redo_draft, re-present, ask again.
   - Approve: call approve_draft. Only on a verified approve does the stage
     gate become "completed".
7. Once completed, call advance_stage again and repeat from step 2. When
   21-abm-strategy-presentation is completed, report both final deliverables
   in outputs/.

Every tool call is stateless and takes client_slug explicitly - never assume
you remember project state from earlier in the conversation, especially
across a session gap. Always re-fetch via get_project_status or
get_stage_context and trust what they report over your own memory.
